DSE4231,Topics in Data Science and the Digital Economy,"This course covers topics at the intersection of economic theory, data science and econometrics. Though the exact topics are dependent on the lecturer(s), they broadly consist of two parts. The first part introduces the relevant economic theory and concepts, as well as the state of the current empirical literature. The second part equips students with relevant state-of-the-art data science methods, such as relevant machine learning techniques and methods relying on big data environments; and demonstrates their application in the context of pertinent economic applications. Some potential applications may include causal inference about treatment effects, demand estimation, experiment design, etc.",DSE
EC4308,Machine Learning and Economic Forecasting,"The course will introduce the students to machine learning and data mining methods for economics problems. It will provide a conceptual understanding of the popular machine learning supervised methods including decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines as well as some unsupervised learning methods. Students will be able to learn how these methods differ from and complement the econometric models and to choose the right one for a given task. To apply the theory, the student will work on hands-on in-class examples, assignments, and the final project.",DSE
