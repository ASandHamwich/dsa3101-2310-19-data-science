This course covers the elements of economic forecasting. We cover both methods for generating economic forecasts, as well as for evaluating forecasts. The methods discussed are primarily ARMA and regression-based models, although some nonlinear techniques are also discussed. We will also discuss practical issues such as producing and evaluating multi-step ahead forecasts, dealing with misspecification, and using mixed frequency data.
