The DSE curriculum incorporates inter-disciplinary learning from data science and economics, with foundations in computer science, mathematics and statistics. In addition to higher-level courses that integrate knowledge and concepts from lower-level core foundational courses, students also read courses related to the application of data science and analytics to the financial market, labour market, and other applied economic issues in education, health, housing and industrial organisation."
